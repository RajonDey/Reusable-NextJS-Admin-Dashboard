## Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/RajonDey/Reusable-NextJS-Admin-Dashboard.git

2. Install Dependencies:
cd your-project-name
npm install

3. Run Development Server:
-- Frontend:
npm run dev

This will start the Next.js development server, typically accessible at http://localhost:3000 by default.
-- Mock Server (for development only):
json-server --watch db.json --port 3001
In a separate terminal window, run the json-server to simulate API calls:
This creates a mock server that serves data from the db.json file (adjust the port if necessary).
